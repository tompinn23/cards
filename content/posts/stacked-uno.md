Stacked uno is uno on steroids we developed whilst bored at sixth form on our free periods.

## Setup

Dish out the standard uno cards seven to each player as if you were playing a normal game. If using bank and the
1 to 10 modifications. Make sure you have plenty of room between each player.

## Playing the game

Stacked uno typically plays out as a standard uno game with a few differences outlined below:

1. Any number card can be stacked on top another number of the same value. When the stack ends due to 
next player being unable to continue said stack. The player has to draw half of the total value of the
stack (The value is the sum of all cards on the stack) rounded up to the nearest whole number.
2. All + cards can be stacked on top of each other.
3. A +2 or +4 can be stacked onto a normal number stack however a number cannot be stacked on a +2 or +4
4. If a stack is of a single colour the value is not halved. And it cannot be canceled in any way.
5. A standard skip turn or wild card can cancel a numbered stack but not a +2/+4 stack.

## Modifiers

### The Bank

The bank is a way of storing cards that you can play in one go. You can build up streaks in a bank but all
cards are viewable by other players. During a standard turn you can either play a card OR put one into the
bank. You may also chose to draw your cards straight into the bank.

### Face Down

You may choose to draw a card and place it face down on the table. You then HAVE to play it in a rounds time.
If it is a valid play you can discard 2 cards. However if invalid you have to have to draw 2 cards.


### 1 to 10 streak.

In 1 to 10 streak you have to collect 0 to 9 of the same colour. When you complete this you can play a 10 streakwhich forces the next person to pick up the entire discard pile.
